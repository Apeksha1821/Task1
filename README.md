 1. Loaded the Dataset:

 We loaded the dataset from a .zip file and displayed basic information about the DataFrame, such as its shape and column data types.

 2. Checked for Missing Values:

 We checked if there were any missing values in the dataset using df.isnull().sum(), which showed that no columns had missing values initially. However, the original code you provided was attempting to fill columns that did not exist in the dataset (e.g., 'director', 'cast', etc.).
 3. Updated Missing Value Filling Logic:

 Since the dataset didnâ€™t have the columns you were attempting to fill, we updated the code to focus on the existing columns like 'gender', 'neighbourhood', 'scheduledday', etc.
 We used a defaults dictionary to specify default values for each of these columns when missing values are found (e.g., filling missing 'gender' with 'Unknown').

 4. Cleaned Column Names:

 We cleaned the column names by making them lowercase, stripping whitespace, and replacing non-alphanumeric characters with underscores (_).

5. Handled Specific Columns:

* For the columns that existed in the dataset ('gender', 'neighbourhood', etc.), we applied string manipulation (like stripping spaces and capitalizing text) where necessary.

 Outcome:

 We adjusted the code to fill missing values in the appropriate columns based on your dataset's actual structure.
The code also ensures that column names are standardized and cleaned for consistency.
